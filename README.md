- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wainhouse
- 👀 I’m interested in web applications, API integration and building apps and software. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java and ReactJS and how to be efficient as possible with my code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I'm not too sure yet, give me 3 months to work all this out.
- 📫 You can reach me by email, I'll leave it at the bottom.
